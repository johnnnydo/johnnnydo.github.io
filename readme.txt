--Readme document for *author*--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone elseâ€™s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?

*/13
- */1 Readme
- */2 Basic HTML content
- */2 Basic CSS styling
- */2 Advanced feature
- */3 Responsive layout
- */1 Passes validation checks
- */2 Embraces spirit of the assignment

I believe I earned 13/13 points on this assignment because I followed all of the requirements that was needed. And I attempted many features that 
embraced the spirit of this project such as the built in console I made to mimic code and the Navigation bar. I also made this a responsive website
by making use of the grid-system using containers, made use of flex/flexbox , and used percentages for sizing whenever I could in order to make it responsive.

2. What (a) basic features, (b) CSS features, and (c) advanced features did you include in your portfolio?

(a) Basic features

To name 3 as requirements said:
- I had an image with a descriptive alt tag
- I used semantic html tags such as section
- had links to external pages
- I had appropriate headers and paragraph text

(b) CSS features

To name a few
- used flex to center all my content while using containers
- I changed my margins and padding to fit how I want
- I changed text color 

(c) Advanced features

- I created a console which mimiced code, but was a introduction
- I also created a navigation bar that hides itself and appears as you scroll down.


3. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?

- Hard to tell, but I used up more than a week and at least 10-12hours of work.

4. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs)

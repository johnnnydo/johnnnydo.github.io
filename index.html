                <h4>Hello There! I'm Johnny, an aspiring Software Engineering and a 2nd Year Software Engineering Student at UC Irvine
    
                Although I am fairly new to computer science in comparison to a lot of my peers. I love computer science so far and the creativity of it. 
                I have not had the chance to dive into different technologies, but I am interested in learning web/app development as well as ML.</h4>
